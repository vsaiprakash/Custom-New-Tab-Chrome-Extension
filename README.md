# Custom-New-Tab-Chrome-Extension
Trying to make a chrome extension, which modifies the new tab with time, welcome message, ...etc.,

This Extension Overrides the empty new tab with a custom wallpaper.
Currently I am using a Wallpaper hardcoded i.e., a wallpaper in this extension package itself.
I shows time with a message:-

  "Good Morning" if time is between 12:00AM to 12:00PM
  
  "Good Evening" if time is between 12:00PM to 6:00PM
